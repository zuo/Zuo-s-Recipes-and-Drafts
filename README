Repo content:
[code in Python, unless something else marked explicitly]

* clonetools/*
  -- tools for cloning classes and functions, useful when you need to
     "copy" a class or a function to adjust it (e.g. adding __slots__
     to all base clases), not hurting the original class/function;
  -- IT'S AN ALPHA VERSION!

  * clonetools/flatmirror.py
    -- a part of clonetools that can be used as a standalone module;
    -- for making "flat mirrors" of classes i.e. fake subclasses with
       reduced class hierarchy.

* trace_logging.py
  -- just import, call and log your selected call/return/exception events
     with standard Python logging framework;
  -- quite flexible tool and just about 50 efective SLOC (excluding the
     example script);
  -- it's rather for debugging than production environments (programs
     noticeably slow down).

* ... [to be continued :)]
