Repo content:

* clonetools/*
  -- IT'S AN ALPHA VERSION!
  -- tools for cloning classes and functions, useful when you need to
     "copy" a class or a function to adjust it (e.g. adding __slots__
     to all base clases), not hurting the original class/function.

  * clonetools/flatmirror.py
    -- a part of clonetools that can be used as a standalone module;
    -- for making "flat mirrors" of classes i.e. fake subclasses with
       flattened class hierarchy.

* ... [to be continued :)]
